-- Sample data for question_papers table
-- This script inserts question papers for all schools and both exam types
-- If a record already exists (based on school_id and exam_type_id), it will update the existing record
-- This is achieved using the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause, which relies on the unique_school_exam_type constraint
-- The constraint ensures that there can only be one question paper for each combination of school and exam type
-- This prevents duplicate entries if the script is run multiple times

-- Insert question papers for School of Engineering & Technology
